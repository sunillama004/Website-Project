               <p class="exp-li">For my overall webpage, I have chosen a dimly-lit background, images, and fonts to
                  create
                  a viewing experience that is less straining on the eyes, while still maintaining an attractive
                  appearance. I placed my name logo in the top left corner, and all the navigation links are centered
                  with
                  a dim black color to improve the user experience. At the bottom of the page, I have added a short and
                  cute footer with a top-left and top-right radius design that displays the copyright information.

                     I placed this background image in the hero section to make a strong first impression. After
                     scrolling down, I wanted to display a section dedicated to my hobbies. To the left of the hero
                     section, I included an image of myself with a circular border, a greeting, and a brief description
                     of who I am. As you continue scrolling down, you will see content that is dedicated to my hobbies.
                     Each hobby has a short description and is displayed in a unique card format.
